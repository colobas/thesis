# is it too slow?
- profile simple-halfmoon
- profile variational-mog
- think about the profiling results
- move to inesc

# batch normalization
- can speed up learning

# weight sharing
- can also speed up learning
- it makes sense, intuitively

# real-nvp
- is there a usable/portable pytorch implementation?
- is it well implemented?
- profile it
- mixture of real-nvps
