Anomaly Detection is the problem of telling anomalous data points from normal
ones, given a dataset of normal points. A sensible approach to this problem is
to try to model the normal behaviour of the system that produces these data
points with a probabilistic model, and use that model to infer the probability
of new data points being normal or anomalous.
